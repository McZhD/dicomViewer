# 1.How to start.
This program is based on Python3, the required Modules are listed in the file requirements.txt. To run this program, put the viewergui.py and dicomanal.py in the same folder, cd to this folder and run the command "pythonw viewergui.py". Please note that the "pythonw" is used here instead of "python" here to avoid the "This program needs access to the screen" problem.

# 2.Open Patient Button
Click this button and select the folder that stores the '.dcm' files of the patient. Then the path of the folder will be displayed on the text box next to it and the image of the first dicom file (sorted by the name of the files) will be displayed.
